# bga-scripts
Mostly userscripts and userstyles for boardgamearena.com

## What’s up?
<a href="custom-styles.user.styl">A leaner game lobby</a> plus other refinements (plain background!) for BGA in general, <a href="game-logs-decluttered.user.styl">decluttered game logs</a>, clearly visible <a href="starting-player-tag.user.js">starting player tag</a> and <a href="replay-with-keys.user.js">keyboard support for replays</a>. In addition there are some sorely missed fixes and improvements for <a href="/carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>, spatial improvements especially for 2p <a href="/arknova">Ark Nova</a> and <a href="/hanamikoji">Hanamikoji</a> as well as original cards for <a href="/haggis">Haggis</a>.

## Prerequisites
<a href="https://violentmonkey.github.io/">Violentmonkey</a> or the like for .user.js-files. 
<a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme">Stylus</a> or some other way to apply .user.styl-files. Config is done within Stylus:

## Problems? Ideas?
All scripts were tested, sometimes even thoroughly. So they should work fine, but might feature rough edges here or there. As I don’t play all games regularly they might even become obsolete or disfunctional over time. So if you encounter any problems please let me know. Either open an issue or contact me on BGA. Same goes if you’d like to see specific improvements.
