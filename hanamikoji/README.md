# bga-hanamikoji-userstyle
Userstyle for Hanamikoji on BGA.

## Features
- reduced whitespace/margins (cf. <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/bug?id=86955">bug 86955</a>)
- a fixed spot for waiting_card_zone (cf. <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/bug?id=86954">bug 86954</a>)

## Prerequisites
<a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme">Stylus</a> or some other way to apply a .user.styl to websites.

## Notes
It should work fine on windows/screens 1280px or wider and with "Player area position" set to "Above". Some margins are pretty tight. So in some edge cases cards overlap other graphics slightly (e.g. 5*5).

## Screenshots
â€¦ with exactly the same dimensions. (Please just ignore the grey background. I use it everywhere on BGA.)
